Curio: Great questions! Let's break these concepts down:

### Mass
Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. It is a scalar quantity and is often measured in kilograms (kg). Mass is a fundamental property of an object, and it does not change regardless of the object's location in the universe. 

### Acceleration
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time. It is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. Acceleration is typically measured in meters per second squared (m/sÂ²). When an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it is experiencing acceleration.

### Newton's First Law
Newton's First Law of Motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force. This law highlights the concept of inertia, which is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion.

### Understanding Better
1. **Why is mass important in physics?**
2. **Can you think of examples of acceleration in everyday life?**
3. **How do you see Newton's First Law in action?**
