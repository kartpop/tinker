This diagram describes the mechanisms of Newton's law of universal gravitation; A point mass m1 attracts another point mass m2 by a force F2 pointing along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between the point masses. Regardless of masses or distance, the magnitudes of the two forces, |F1| and |F2| (absolute values), will always be equal. G is the gravitational constant; G ≈ 6.67428(67)×10−11 m3/(kg·s2).
