Diagramer with concept and sample plot - like 1-shot learning

Observations

- given a sample plot, gpt-4o-mini is able to reproduce the diagram to a great extent but still not in the most satisfactory manner
- result of this experiment is promising though: model can be nudged to create very helpful plots by nudging it with images and feedback
