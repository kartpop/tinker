# Frontend
- custom scrollbar 
- change background theme from orange to white/transparent, keep orange highlights


# AI
- https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigdata-pw/Dinosaurs - source for structured dinosaur data

### Indexing pipeline
- Create embedder with metadata_fields_to_embed


---------------------------------------

### Adhoc tasks

- Test out LLM's capabilities in writing Manim code with few-shot learning
    - Create 3-5 example animations/diagrams in rigid body motion (say)
    - Prompt model to create a new animation/diagram in similar field to test how it works

- Idea
    - Create a corpus of 100s of example manim animation code snippets along with labelled metadata
        - Labelled metadata: detailed description of animation, each line of code has useful comments
    - When a concept is generated by LLM to explain a phenomenon:
        - feed the concept text to animator/diagramer agent
        - agent first performs semantic search to get the top_k relevant examples (animation code + description)
        - agent invokes LLM to prepare detailed plan for the animation using the top_k examples as context
        - agent then invokes LLM again to prepare final animation code
    - Postprocess
        - If the animation is satisfactory: what crietria to choose?? ask LLM again?
        - send diagram/animation to UI
        - save diagram/animation with description into vector database to add to the existing examples
    - Enhancement:
        - Create a custom finetuned model on animation data (once corpus reaches a few 10,000 datasets)
